# Logistic Regression Model for User Purchase Prediction
This code is a machine learning model that uses logistic regression to predict whether a user will purchase a product or not, based on the user's age and estimated salary.

## Techniques Used
1. Data preparation and feature scaling
2. Logistic regression
3. Evaluation with confusion matrix and accuracy score
4. Running the Code

## To run the code, you will need to have the following packages installed:
```
pandas
numpy
matplotlib
sklearn
```
You can install these packages using pip.

## Once you have the necessary packages installed, you can run the code by using the following command:

> python user_purchase_prediction.py
## Output
The code will output:
```
A confusion matrix showing the number of true positive, false positive, false negative, and true negative predictions made by the model
An accuracy score, which is the percentage of correct predictions made by the model.
```
